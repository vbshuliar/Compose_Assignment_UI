# Compose Assignment UI
This project is part of my Android Development Specialization provided by Meta on Coursera. In this project, I implemented a UI for the Little Lemon app.

## Description by Meta
The primary purpose of a graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed. Most importantly, graded assessments help you establish which topics you have mastered and which require further focus before completing the course. 

Ultimately, the graded assessment is designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned. This assessment's learning objective is to allow you to create a UI for the Little Lemon app.
